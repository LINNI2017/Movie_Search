### Question to answer
```
Q: Why do we create this mapping between a DocId and a filename, rather than just storing a list of filenames?
```
```
A: It makes easier to search in docs with a mapping between doc_id and file_name. 
   For example, we want to find the file with Harry Potter recorded, 
   it is easier to update the concrete doc file and virtual data, 
   but it is more difficult to change it through a list of filenames.
```

### Clint.py style check
```
./clint.py DirectoryParser.c DocIdMap.c DocSet.c MovieTitleIndex.c QueryProcessor.c main.c
```
```
Done processing DirectoryParser.c
Done processing DocIdMap.c
Done processing DocSet.c
Done processing MovieTitleIndex.c
Done processing QueryProcessor.c
Done processing main.c
Total errors found: 0
```

### Valgrind memory check
```
